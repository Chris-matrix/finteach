This project is a Node.js application that uses Express.js as the web framework and MySQL as the database, with Sequelize as the ORM.

## Description

This application demonstrates how to set up a Node.js server with Express, connect to a MySQL database using Sequelize, and define User and Transaction models. It's designed to provide a foundation for building robust web applications with user management and transaction tracking capabilities.
